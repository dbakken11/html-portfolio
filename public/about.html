<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Thank you for chekcing out my website. At the moment it is under construction and I hope to improve on further!</p>

<p>My name is Daniel Bakken and currently I am a GIS Analyst for the Ada County Sheriff's Department located in Idaho.
After graduating from the University of Idaho in May 2022 with a B.S. Geography I moved back down to the Treasure Valley to being my professional career in the world of GIS.

</p>

<p>I have now been a Geospatial professional for over two years, and in that time I have been shown the utility of geospatial applications. It is my intent to use this 
  protoflio website to showcase my skills in coding, and to showcase some applications that I am able to create. So please visit this site again in the future to see how it grows.
